# Challenge_9 Surfs_Up
## Description
In this project, the objective was to get summary statistics on the temperature for the months of June and December. To do this, Python and Sqlite were utilized.

## Results 
June summary:

- Temperatures are higher in June than in December in all areas of the statistics
- There are less observations in December than there are in June.
- In spite of the higher overall difference, in the 75% percentile and the maximum temperature recorded of both months were closer than the rest, being only 2-3 degrees different respectively.

## Summary
The temperature differences are as a result of Hawaii being in the northern hemisphere, where summer months, like June, are warmer than winter months, like December.
Though, Hawaii's distance from the equator is relatively small compared to most locations in the northern hemisphere, hence the only mild temperature differences. 
To provide good supplemental weather information, a query and statistics overview like the ones provided, but on precipitation, would be helpful to understand when
rain comes through and how much. A second query, though length one, might be done on each individual observation station for each month for precipitation and temperature. With this way, a more ideal location for the business could be determined.
